Jira Service Desk Proxy
======================


This image serves as a very simple proxy to redirect users to the cloud hosted Jira Service Desk instance.

Essentially this lets us put a nice name like:
https://desk.example.com which redirects to https://example.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals
